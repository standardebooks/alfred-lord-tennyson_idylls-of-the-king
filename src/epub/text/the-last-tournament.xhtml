			<p>
				<span>Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made mock-knight of Arthur’s Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the crown thereof a carcanet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came Tristram, saying, ‘Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far down beneath a winding wall of rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing an eagle’s nest: and through the tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierced ever a child’s cry: and crag and tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received, and after loved it tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And named it Nestling; so forgot herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moment, and her cares; till that young life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past from her; and in time the carcanet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the King, ‘Peace to thine eagle-borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead nestling, and this honour after death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘Would rather you had let them fall,’ she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Plunge and be lost⁠—ill-fated as they were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bitterness to me!—ye look amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not knowing they were lost as soon as given⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the river⁠—that unhappy child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With these rich jewels, seeing that they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the sweet body of a maiden babe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance⁠—who knows?—the purest of thy knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May win them for the purest of my maids.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ended, and the cry of a great jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Camelot in among the faded fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed for a day of glory before the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on the hither side of that loud morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A churl, to whom indignantly the King,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man was it who marred heaven’s image in thee thus?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘He took them and he drave them to his tower⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some hold he was a table-knight of thine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred goodly ones⁠—the Red Knight, he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I called upon thy name as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That doest right by gentle and by churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that he sware me to a message, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have founded my Round Table in the North,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whatsoever his own knights have sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knights have sworn the counter to it⁠—and say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My tower is full of harlots, like his court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mine are worthier, seeing they profess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be none other than themselves⁠—and say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knights are all adulterers like his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mine are truer, seeing they profess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be none other; and say his hour is come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen are upon him, his long lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.”⁠ ⁠’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a king’s heir, till all his hurts be whole.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen⁠—but that ever-climbing wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled back again so often in empty foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath lain for years at rest⁠—and renegades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friends, through your manhood and your fealty,—now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make their last head like Satan in the North.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to yield my Queen her own again?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, ‘It is well:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet better if the King abide, and leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The leading of his younger knights to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while they stood without the doors, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to him saying, ‘Is it then so well?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom was written, “A sound is in his ears”?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foot that loiters, bidden go,—the glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That only seems half-loyal to command,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A manner somewhat fallen from reverence⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By noble deeds at one with noble vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From flat confusion and brute violences,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reel back into the beast, and be no more?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of bygone Merlin, ‘Where is he who knows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the great deep to the great deep he goes.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the morning of a tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By these in earnest those in mockery called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down a streetway hung with folds of pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White samite, and by fountains running wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where children sat in white with cups of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He glanced and saw the stately galleries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White-robed in honour of the stainless child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some with scattered jewels, like a bank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all the goodlier guests are past away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat their great umpire, looking o’er the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw the laws that ruled the tournament</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his throne of arbitration cursed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dead babe and the follies of the King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once the laces of a helmet cracked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice that billowed round the barriers roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But newly-entered, taller than the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armoured all in forest green, whereon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ever-scattering berries, and on shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spear, a harp, a bugle⁠—Tristram⁠—late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From overseas in Brittany returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marriage with a princess of that realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt the White⁠—Sir Tristram of the Woods⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own against him, and now yearned to shake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The burthen off his heart in one full shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Tristram even to death: his strong hands gript</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he groaned for wrath⁠—so many of those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ware their ladies’ colours on the casque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there with gibes and flickering mockeries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood, while he muttered, ‘Craven crests! O shame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What faith have these in whom they sware to love?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glory of our Round Table is no more.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not speaking other word than ‘Hast thou won?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith thou takest this, is red!’ to whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot’s languorous mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, ‘Ay, but wherefore toss me this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest be thy fair Queen’s fantasy. Strength of heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are winners in this pastime of our King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My hand⁠—belike the lance hath dript upon it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram round the gallery made his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Fair damsels, each to him who worships each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And most of these were mute, some angered, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murmuring, ‘All courtesy is dead,’ and one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘The glory of our Round Table is no more.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went glooming down in wet and weariness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But under her black brows a swarthy one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughed shrilly, crying, ‘Praise the patient saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our one white day of Innocence hath past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come⁠—let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot’s, at this night’s solemnity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the kindlier colours of the field.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So dame and damsel glittered at the feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Variously gay: for he that tells the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass under white, till the warm hour returns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dame and damsel cast the simple white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glowing in all colours, the live grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the revels, and with mirth so loud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram saying, ‘Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Belike for lack of wiser company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or being fool, and seeing too much wit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To know myself the wisest knight of all.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Ay, fool,’ said Tristram, ‘but ’tis eating dry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance without a catch, a roundelay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance to.’ Then he twangled on his harp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while he twangled little Dagonet stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quiet as any water-sodden log</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the twangling ended, skipt again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being asked, ‘Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, ‘I had liefer twenty years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skip to the broken music of my brains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any broken music thou canst make.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Good now, what music have I broken, fool?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little Dagonet, skipping, ‘Arthur, the King’s;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou makest broken music with thy bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daintier namesake down in Brittany⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so thou breakest Arthur’s music too.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Save for that broken music in thy brains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Fool,’ said Tristram, ‘I would break thy head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The life had flown, we sware but by the shell⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am but a fool to reason with a fool⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou art crabbed and sour: but lean me down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses’ ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And harken if my music be not true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘⁠ ⁠“Free love⁠—free field⁠—we love but while we may:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woods are hushed, their music is no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New leaf, new life⁠—the days of frost are o’er:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New life, new love, to suit the newer day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New loves are sweet as those that went before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free love⁠—free field⁠—we love but while we may.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard it ring as true as tested gold.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made to run wine?—but this had run itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All out like a long life to a sour end⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And them that round it sat with golden cups</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hand the wine to whosoever came⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In honour of poor Innocence the babe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lent to the King, and Innocence the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave for a prize⁠—and one of those white slips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Drink, drink, Sir Fool,” and thereupon I drank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spat⁠—pish⁠—the cup was gold, the draught was mud.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, ‘Was it muddier than thy gibes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fear God: honour the King⁠—his one true knight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sole follower of the vows”—for here be they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knew thee swine enow before I came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A naked aught⁠—yet swine I hold thee still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of hers, I’ll hold thou hast some touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine? I have wallowed, I have washed⁠—the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is flesh and shadow⁠—I have had my day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath fouled me⁠—an I wallowed, then I washed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have had my day and my philosophies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thank the Lord I am King Arthur’s fool.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On such a wire as musically as thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some such fine song⁠—but never a king’s fool.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, ‘Then were swine, goats, asses, geese</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had such a mastery of his mystery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he could harp his wife up out of hell.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘And whither harp’st thou thine? down! and thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That harpest downward! Dost thou know the star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, ‘Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glorying in each new glory, set his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Dagonet answered, ‘Ay, and when the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To babble about him, all to show your wit⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whether he were King by courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or King by right⁠—and so went harping down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black king’s highway, got so far, and grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur’s vows on the great lake of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘Nay, fool,’ said Tristram, ‘not in open day.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Dagonet, ‘Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It makes a silent music up in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then we skip.’ ‘Lo, fool,’ he said, ‘ye talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool’s treason: is the King thy brother fool?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conceits himself as God that he can make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men from beasts⁠—Long live the king of fools!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And down the city Dagonet danced away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But through the slowly-mellowing avenues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solitary passes of the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ruby-circled neck, but evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unruffling waters re-collect the shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one that in them sees himself, returned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So on for all that day from lawn to lawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through many a league-long bower he rode. At length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against a shower, dark in the golden grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appearing, sent his fancy back to where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With six or seven, when Tristram was away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But could not rest for musing how to smoothe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But then what folly had sent him overseas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After she left him lonely here? a name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it the name of one in Brittany,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt, the daughter of the King? ‘Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the white hands’ they called her: the sweet name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allured him first, and then the maid herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who served him well with those white hands of hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved him well, until himself had thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loved her also, wedded easily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left her all as easily, and returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had drawn him home⁠—what marvel? then he laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to struggle for it, till his Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then cried the Breton, ‘Look, her hand is red!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And melts within her hand⁠—her hand is hot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all as cool and white as any flower.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed a rush of eagle’s wings, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A whimpering of the spirit of the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode far, till o’er the illimitable reed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glared on a huge machicolated tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A roar of riot, as from men secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Lo there,’ said one of Arthur’s youth, for there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on a grim dead tree before the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A goodly brother of the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At that dishonour done the gilded spur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sent the face of all the marsh aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woman-worshipper? Yea, God’s curse, and I!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slain was the brother of my paramour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stings itself to everlasting death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hang whatever knight of thine I fought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tumbled. Art thou King?—Look to thy life!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard in dead night along that table-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drops flat, and after the great waters break</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From less and less to nothing; thus he fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There trampled out his face from being known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through open doors, and swording right and left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tables over and the wines, and slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the pavement streamed with massacre:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which half that autumn night, like the live North,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made all above it, and a hundred meres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About it, as the water Moab saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whistled his good warhorse left to graze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stayed him. ‘Why weep ye?’ ‘Lord,’ she said, ‘my man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath left me or is dead;’ whereon he thought⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What, if she hate me now? I would not this.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, if she love me still? I would not that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not what I would’—but said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He find thy favour changed and love thee not’—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A crown of towers.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Down in a casement sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belted his body with her white embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying aloud, ‘Not Mark⁠—not Mark, my soul!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The footstep fluttered me at first: not he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who hates thee, as I him⁠—even to the death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom Sir Tristram smiling, ‘I am here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And drawing somewhat backward she replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Can he be wronged who is not even his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But save for dread of thee had beaten me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow⁠—Mark?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What rights are his that dare not strike for them?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not lift a hand⁠—not, though he found me thus!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But harken! have ye met him? hence he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Today for three days’ hunting⁠—as he said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so returns belike within an hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark’s way, my soul!—but eat not thou with Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because he hates thee even more than fears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My God, the measure of my hate for Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is as the measure of my love for thee.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O hunter, and O blower of the horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, ere I mated with my shambling king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye twain had fallen out about the bride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one⁠—his name is out of me⁠—the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If prize she were⁠—(what marvel⁠—she could see)—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, ‘Last to my Queen Paramount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here now to my Queen Paramount of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loveliness⁠—ay, lovelier than when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing from Ireland.’</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Softly laughed Isolt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My dole of beauty trebled?’ and he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thine is more to me⁠—soft, gracious, kind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make one doubt if ever the great Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have yielded him her love.’</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To whom Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I⁠—misyoked with such a want of man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I could hardly sin against the lowest.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answered, ‘O my soul, be comforted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made us happy: but how ye greet me⁠—fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fault and doubt⁠—no word of that fond tale⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Tristram in that year he was away.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I had forgotten all in my strong joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see thee⁠—yearnings?—ay! for, hour by hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the never-ended afternoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O sweeter than all memories of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper than any yearnings after thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watched from this tower. Isolt of Britain dashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would that have chilled her bride-kiss? Wedded her?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fought in her father’s battles? wounded there?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well⁠—can I wish her any huger wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than having known thee? her too hast thou left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pine and waste in those sweet memories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O were I not my Mark’s, by whom all men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did I love her? the name at least I loved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt?—I fought his battles, for Isolt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The name was ruler of the dark⁠—Isolt?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Isolt answered, ‘Yea, and why not I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark’s way to steal behind one in the dark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there was Mark: “He has wedded her,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not said, but hissed it: then this crown of towers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So shook to such a roar of all the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That here in utter dark I swooned away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And woke again in utter dark, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will flee hence and give myself to God”—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou wert lying in thy new leman’s arms.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past desire!’ a saying that angered her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘⁠ ⁠“May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet no more to me!” I need Him now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the swineherd’s malkin in the mast?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greater man, the greater courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far other was the Tristram, Arthur’s knight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes thee well⁠—art grown wild beast thyself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How darest thou, if lover, push me even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fancy from thy side, and set me far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the gray distance, half a life away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solemnly as when ye sware to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man of men, our King⁠—My God, the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was once in vows when men believed the King!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King prevailing made his realm:⁠—I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knighthood taught me this⁠—ay, being snapt⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We run more counter to the soul thereof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once⁠—even to the height⁠—I honoured him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Man, is he man at all?” methought, when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That victor of the Pagan throned in hall⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden beard that clothed his lips with light⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Merlin’s mystic babble about his end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being amazed: but this went by⁠—The vows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O ay⁠—the wholesome madness of an hour⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They served their use, their time; for every knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believed himself a greater than himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every follower eyed him as a God;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so the realm was made; but then their vows⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First mainly through that sullying of our Queen⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bind them by inviolable vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For feel this arm of mine⁠—the tide within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red with free chase and heather-scented air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any maiden child? lock up my tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From uttering freely what I freely hear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worldling of the world am I, and know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woos his own end; we are not angels here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shall be: vows⁠—I am woodman of the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore is my love so large for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing it is not bounded save by love.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Good: an I turned away my love for thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To some one thrice as courteous as thyself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For courtesy wins woman all as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As valour may, but he that closes both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is perfect, he is Lancelot⁠—taller indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rosier and comelier, thou⁠—but say I loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine own small saw, “We love but while we may,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well then, what answer?’</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He that while she spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warm white apple of her throat, replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Press this a little closer, sweet, until⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, I am hungered and half-angered⁠—meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine, wine⁠—and I will love thee to the death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out beyond into the dream to come.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So then, when both were brought to full accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She rose, and set before him all he willed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after these had comforted the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now talking of their woodland paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now mocking at the much ungainliness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that bend the brier!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A star in heaven, a star within the mere!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—a star was my desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was far apart, and one was near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that bow the grass!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was water and one star was fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one will ever shine and one will pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that move the mere.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in the light’s last glimmer Tristram showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘The collar of some Order, which our King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘Not so, my Queen,’ he said, ‘but the red fruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither brought by Tristram for his last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claspt it, and cried, ‘Thine Order, O my Queen!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Mark’s way,’ said Mark, and clove him through the brain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great Queen’s bower was dark,—about his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What art thou?’ and the voice about his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent up an answer, sobbing, ‘I am thy fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I shall never make thee smile again.’</span>
