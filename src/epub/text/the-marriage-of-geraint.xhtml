			<h2 epub:type="title">The Marriage of Geraint</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tributary prince of Devon, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that great Order of the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had married Enid, Yniol’s only child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the light of Heaven varies, now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her beauty vary day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In crimsons and in purples and in gems.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid, but to please her husband’s eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first had found and loved her in a state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved her, and often with her own white hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next after her own self, in all the court.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adored her, as the stateliest and the best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loveliest of all women upon earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing them so tender and so close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when a rumour rose about the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world’s loud whisper breaking into storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had suffered, or should suffer any taint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In nature: wherefore going to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made this pretext, that his princedom lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close on the borders of a territory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assassins, and all flyers from the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore, till the King himself should please</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He craved a fair permission to depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there defend his marches; and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Severn, and they past to their own land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He compassed her with sweet observances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worship, never leaving her, and grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his promise to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his glory and his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by and by the people, when they met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In twos and threes, or fuller companies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And molten down in mere uxoriousness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this she gathered from the people’s eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This too the women who attired her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But could not out of bashful delicacy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he that watched her sadden, was the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suspicious that her nature had a taint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last, it chanced that on a summer morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(They sleeping each by either) the new sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat through the blindless casement of the room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bared the knotted column of his throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The massive square of his heroic breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As slopes a wild brook o’er a little stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running too vehemently to break upon it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Admiring him, and thought within herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was ever man so grandly made as he?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, like a shadow, past the people’s talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And accusation of uxoriousness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across her mind, and bowing over him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low to her own heart piteously she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O noble breast and all-puissant arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am the cause, because I dare not speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell him what I think and what they say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I hate that he should linger here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot love my lord and not his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride with him to battle and stand by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch his mightful hand striking great blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far better were I laid in the dark earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not hearing any more his noble voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be folded more in these dear arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darkened from the high light in his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet not dare to tell him what I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how men slur him, saying all his force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is melted into mere effeminacy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me, I fear that I am no true wife.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the strong passion in her made her weep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True tears upon his broad and naked breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these awoke him, and by great mischance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He heard but fragments of her later words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that she feared she was not a true wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he thought, “In spite of all my care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is not faithful to me, and I see her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur’s hall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then though he loved and reverenced her too much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dream she could be guilty of foul act,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right through his manful breast darted the pang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes a man, in the sweet face of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My charger and her palfrey;” then to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will ride forth into the wilderness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have not fallen so low as some would wish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride with me.” And Enid asked, amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, “I charge thee, ask not, but obey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she bethought her of a faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A faded mantle and a faded veil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein she kept them folded reverently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She took them, and arrayed herself therein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering when first he came on her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his journey to her, as himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There on a day, he sitting high in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him came a forester of Dean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First seen that day: these things he told the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the good King gave order to let blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the King petitioned for his leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see the hunt, allowed it easily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with the morning all the court were gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Guinevere lay late into the morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rose at last, a single maiden with her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A purple scarf, at either end whereof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There swung an apple of the purest gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swayed round about him, as he galloped up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In summer suit and silks of holiday.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet and statelily, and with all grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Late, late, Sir Prince,” she said, “later than we!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, noble Queen,” he answered, “and so late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I but come like you to see the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not join it.” “Therefore wait with me,” she said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For on this little knoll, if anywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here often they break covert at our feet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while they listened for the distant hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Arthur’s hound of deepest mouth, there rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Guinevere, not mindful of his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the King’s hall, desired his name, and sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being vicious, old and irritable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doubling all his master’s vice of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer sharply that she should not know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then will I ask it of himself,” she said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,” cried the dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she put her horse toward the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exclaiming, “Surely I will learn the name,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who answered as before; and when the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince’s blood spirted upon the scarf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, from his exceeding manfulness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pure nobility of temperament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From even a word, and so returning said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done in your maiden’s person to yourself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will track this vermin to their earths:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find, at some place I shall come at, arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the third day will again be here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that I be not fallen in fight. Farewell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Farewell, fair Prince,” answered the stately Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may you light on all things that you love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And live to wed with her whom first you love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, were she the daughter of a king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little vext at losing of the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little at the vile occasion, rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And valley, with fixt eye following the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last they issued from the world of wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither there came Geraint, and underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the long street of a little town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a long valley, on one side whereof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White from the mason’s hand, a fortress rose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on one side a castle in decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of town and valley came a noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a broad brook o’er a shingly bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At distance, ere they settle for the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And onward to the fortress rode the three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And entered, and were lost behind the walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So,” thought Geraint, “I have tracked him to his earth.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the long street riding wearily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found every hostel full, and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His master’s armour; and of such a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He asked, “What means the tumult in the town?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who told him, scouring still, “The sparrow-hawk!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then riding close behind an ancient churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who answered gruffly, “Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then riding further past an armourer’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He put the selfsame query, but the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has little time for idle questioners.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The murmur of the world! What is it to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where can I get me harbourage for the night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat the armourer turning all amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing one so gay in purple silks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came forward with the helmet yet in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Pardon me, O stranger knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is scantly time for half the work.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It may be, at Earl Yniol’s, o’er the bridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yonder.” He spoke and fell to work again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither, fair son?” to whom Geraint replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Yniol, “Enter therefore and partake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slender entertainment of a house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thanks, venerable friend,” replied Geraint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For supper, I will enter, I will eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the passion of a twelve hours’ fast.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Graver cause than yours is mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will not touch upon him even in jest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rode Geraint into the castle court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His charger trampling many a prickly star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked and saw that all was ruinous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here had fallen a great part of a tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And high above a piece of turret stair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while he waited in the castle court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of Enid, Yniol’s daughter, rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear through the open casement of the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moves him to think what kind of bird it is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sings so delicately clear, and make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjecture of the plumage and the form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made him like a man abroad at morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first the liquid note beloved of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes flying over many a windy wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Britain, and in April suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he suspends his converse with a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or it may be the labour of his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think or say, “There is the nightingale;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here, by God’s grace, is the one voice for me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It chanced the song that Enid sang was one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With that wild wheel we go not up or down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For man is man and master of his fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hark, by the bird’s song ye may learn the nest,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Yniol; “enter quickly.” Entering then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right o’er a mount of newly-fallen stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here by God’s rood is the one maid for me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But none spake word except the hoary Earl:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Enid, the good knight’s horse stands in the court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will make us merry as we may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake: the Prince, as Enid past him, fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His purple scarf, and held, and said, “Forbear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endures not that her guest should serve himself.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reverencing the custom of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Enid took his charger to the stall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after went her way across the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet spoke together, came again with one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A youth, that following with a costrel bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, because their hall must also serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood behind, and waited on the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint had longing in him evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That crost the trencher as she laid it down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But after all had eaten, then Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the wine made summer in his veins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let his eye rove in following, or rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if he be the knight whom late I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ride into that new fortress by your town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White from the mason’s hand, then have I sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his own lips to have it⁠—I am Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Devon⁠—for this morning when the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent her own maiden to demand the name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I would track this caitiff to his hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take the rustic murmur of their bourg</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the great wave that echoes round the world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would not hear me speak: but if ye know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I can light on arms, or if yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I will break his pride and learn his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Avenging this great insult done the Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried Earl Yniol, “Art thou he indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint, a name far-sounded among men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For noble deeds? and truly I, when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw you moving by me on the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presence might have guessed you one of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eat in Arthur’s hall in Camelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this dear child hath often heard me praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your feats of arms, and often when I paused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So grateful is the noise of noble deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O never yet had woman such a pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suitors as this maiden: first Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not, but he past to the wild land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My curse, my nephew⁠—I will not let his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slip from my lips if I can help it⁠—he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that I knew him fierce and turbulent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since the proud man often is the mean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sowed a slander in the common ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affirming that his father left him gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bribed with large promises the men who served</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About my person, the more easily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because my means were somewhat broken into</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through open doors and hospitality;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised my own town against me in the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before my Enid’s birthday, sacked my house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From mine own earldom foully ousted me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built that new fort to overawe my friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truly there are those who love me yet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that his pride too much despises me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself sometimes despise myself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have let men be, and have their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am much too gentle, have not used my power:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor know I whether I be very base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or very manful, whether very wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or very foolish; only this I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whatsoever evil happen to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But can endure it all most patiently.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well said, true heart,” replied Geraint, “but arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In next day’s tourney I may break his pride.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Yniol answered, “Arms, indeed, but old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in this tournament can no man tilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the lady he loves best be there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over these is placed a silver wand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prize of beauty for the fairest there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this, what knight soever be in field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays claim to for the lady at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being apt at arms and big of bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has ever won it for the lady with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toppling over all antagonism</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has earned himself the name of ‘sparrow-hawk.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaning a little toward him, “Thy leave!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me lay lance in rest, O noble host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this dear child, because I never saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though having seen all beauties of our time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I fall her name will yet remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untarnished as before; but if I live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I will make her truly my true wife.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, howsoever patient, Yniol’s heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looking round he saw not Enid there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that old dame, to whom full tenderly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folding all her hand in his he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And best by her that bore her understood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With frequent smile and nod departing found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On either shining shoulder laid a hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kept her off and gazed upon her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told them all their converse in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proving her heart: but never light and shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coursed one another more on open ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the face of Enid hearing her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While slowly falling as a scale that falls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When weight is added only grain by grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So moving without answer to her rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She found no rest, and ever failed to draw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quiet night into her blood, but lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contemplating her own unworthiness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the pale and bloodless east began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thither came the twain, and when Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself beyond the rest pushing could move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chair of Idris. Yniol’s rusted arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were on his princely person, but through these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ladies came, and by and by the town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they fixt the forks into the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over these they placed the silver wand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Yniol’s nephew, after trumpet blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I these two years past have won for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prize of beauty.” Loudly spake the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Forbear: there is a worthier,” and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With some surprise and thrice as much disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So burnt he was with passion, crying out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do battle for it then,” no more; and thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So often and with such blows, that all the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wondered, and now and then from distant walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a clapping as of phantom hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dew of their great labour, and the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But either’s force was matched till Yniol’s cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Remember that great insult done the Queen,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Increased Geraint’s, who heaved his blade aloft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “Thy name?” To whom the fallen man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, groaning, “Edyrn, son of Nudd!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,” replied Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt ride to Arthur’s court, and coming there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn answered, “These things will I do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have never yet been overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising up, he rode to Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen forgave him easily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being young, he changed and came to loathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great battle fighting for the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the third day from the hunting-morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a low splendour in the world, and wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the dancing shadows of the birds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke and bethought her of her promise given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No later than last eve to Prince Geraint⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So bent he seemed on going the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would not leave her, till her promise given⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride with him this morning to the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there be made known to the stately Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there be wedded with all ceremony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought it never yet had looked so mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as a leaf in mid-November is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To what it is in mid-October, seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dress that now she looked on to the dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still she looked, and still the terror grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All staring at her in her faded silk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And softly to her own sweet heart she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This noble prince who won our earldom back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So splendid in his acts and his attire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would he could tarry with us here awhile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But being so beholden to the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It were but little grace in any of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bent as he seemed on going this third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek a second favour at his hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer than so much discredit him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid fell in longing for a dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her good mother, given her on the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her birthday, three sad years ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scattered all they had to all the winds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For while the mother showed it, and the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were turning and admiring it, the work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To both appeared so costly, rose a cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Edyrn’s men were on them, and they fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With little save the jewels they had on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn’s men had caught them in their flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And placed them in this ruin; and she wished</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince had found her in her ancient home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then let her fancy flit across the past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And roam the goodly places that she knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last bethought her how she used to watch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was patched and blurred and lustreless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among his burnished brethren of the pool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half asleep she made comparison</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that and these to her own faded self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the gay court, and fell asleep again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dreamt herself was such a faded form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among her burnished sisters of the pool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this was in the garden of a king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all was bright; that all about were birds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the turf was rich in plots that looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lords and ladies of the high court went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silver tissue talking things of state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And children of the King in cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she thought “They will not see me,” came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the children in their cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to her, crying, “If we have fish at all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pick the faded creature from the pool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast it on the mixen that it die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal one came and seized on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid started waking, with her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All overshadowed by the foolish dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lo! it was her mother grasping her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get her well awake; and in her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A suit of bright apparel, which she laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fast they hold like colours of a shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why not? It never yet was worn, I trow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid looked, but all confused at first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Yea, I know it; your good gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sadly lost on that unhappy night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own good gift!” “Yea, surely,” said the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And gladly given again this happy morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the jousts were ended yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found the sack and plunder of our house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All scattered through the houses of the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave command that all which once was ours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should now be ours again: and yester-eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came one with this and laid it in my hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because we have our earldom back again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I myself unwillingly have worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And howsoever patient, Yniol his.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That appertains to noble maintenance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all through that young traitor, cruel need</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Constrained us, but a better time has come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So clothe yourself in this, that better fits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mended fortunes and a Prince’s bride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though I heard him call you fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let never maiden think, however fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is not fairer in new clothes than old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And should some great court-lady say, the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a madman brought her to the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom we are beholden; but I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when my dear child is set forth at her best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That neither court nor country, though they sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all the provinces like those of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid listened brightening as she lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, as the white and glittering star of morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helped by the mother’s careful hand and eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never yet had seen her half so fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called her like that maiden in the tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flur, for whose love the Roman Caesar first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Invaded Britain, “But we beat him back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As this great Prince invaded us, and we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I can scarcely ride with you to court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see my princess as I see her now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Enid, and when Yniol made report</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that good mother making Enid gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such apparel as might well beseem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He answered: “Earl, entreat her by my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit I give no reason but my wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she ride with me in her faded silk.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yniol with that hard message went; it fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dared not to glance at her good mother’s face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But silently, in all obedience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mother silent too, nor helping her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And robed them in her ancient suit again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so descended. Never man rejoiced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing all at once as keenly at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As careful robins eye the delver’s toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rested with her sweet face satisfied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then seeing cloud upon the mother’s brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At thy new son, for my petition to her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding one so bright in dark estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunlike from cloud⁠—and likewise thought perhaps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That service done so graciously would bind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The two together; fain I would the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should love each other: how can Enid find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nobler friend? Another thought was mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I came among you here so suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That though her gentle presence at the lists</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might well have served for proof that I was loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I doubted whether daughter’s tenderness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or easy nature, might not let itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether some false sense in her own self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my contrasting brightness, overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such a sense might make her long for court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all its perilous glories: and I thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could I someway prove such force in her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Linked with such love for me, that at a word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(No reason given her) she could cast aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A splendour dear to women, new to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore dearer; or if not so new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of intermitted usage; then I felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A prophet certain of my prophecy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never shadow of mistrust can cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for my strange petition I will make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When your fair child shall wear your costly gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? another gift of the high God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke: the mother smiled, but half in tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And white sails flying on the yellow sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not to goodly hill or yellow sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then descending met them at the gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did her honour as the Prince’s bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that week was old Caerleon gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They twain were wedded with all ceremony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this was on the last year’s Whitsuntide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid ever kept the faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering how first he came on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his journey toward her, as himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now this morning when he said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Put on your worst and meanest dress,” she found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took it, and arrayed herself therein.</span>
