			<h2 epub:type="title">Lancelot and Elaine</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High in her chamber up a tower to the east</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guarded the sacred shield of Lancelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which first she placed where the morning’s earliest ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might strike it, and awake her with the gleam;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A case of silk, and braided thereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the devices blazoned on the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their own tinct, and added, of her wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A border fantasy of branch and flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yellow-throated nestling in the nest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor rested thus content, but day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaving her household and good father, climbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eastern tower, and entering barred her door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript off the case, and read the naked shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now made a pretty history to herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of every dint a sword had beaten in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every scratch a lance had made upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjecturing when and where: this cut is fresh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ten years back; this dealt him at Caerlyle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That at Caerleon; this at Camelot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ah God’s mercy, what a stroke was there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here a thrust that might have killed, but God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the strong lance, and rolled his enemy down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saved him: so she lived in fantasy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How came the lily maid by that good shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, she that knew not even his name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left it with her, when he rode to tilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the great diamond in the diamond jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which Arthur had ordained, and by that name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had named them, since a diamond was the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur, long before they crowned him King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horror lived about the tarn, and clave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like its own mists to all the mountain side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here two brothers, one a king, had met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fought together; but their names were lost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each had slain his brother at a blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down they fell and made the glen abhorred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they lay till all their bones were bleached,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lichened into colour with the crags:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, that once was king, had on a crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a misty moonshine, unawares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolled into light, and turning on its rims</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set it on his head, and in his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard murmurs, “Lo, thou likewise shalt be King.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plucked from the crown, and showed them to his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “These jewels, whereupon I chanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divinely, are the kingdom’s, not the King’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For public use: henceforward let there be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once every year, a joust for one of these:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so by nine years’ proof we needs must learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is our mightiest, and ourselves shall grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In use of arms and manhood, till we drive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, which God hinder.” Thus he spoke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With purpose to present them to the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all were won; but meaning all at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To snare her royal fancy with a boon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now for the central diamond and the last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And largest, Arthur, holding then his court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard on the river nigh the place which now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is this world’s hugest, let proclaim a joust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these fair jousts?” “Yea, lord,” she said, “ye know it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then will ye miss,” he answered, “the great deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sight ye love to look on.” And the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He thinking that he read her meaning there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than many diamonds,” yielded; and a heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(However much he yearned to make complete</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lets me from the saddle;” and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner gone than suddenly she began:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will murmur, ‘Lo the shameless ones, who take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!’ ”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then of the crowd ye took no more account</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every voice is nothing. As to knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Them surely can I silence with all ease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now my loyal worship is allowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all men: many a bard, without offence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has linked our names together in his lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pearl of beauty: and our knights at feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have pledged us in this union, while the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would listen smiling. How then? is there more?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now weary of my service and devoir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She broke into a little scornful laugh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That passionate perfection, my good lord⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never spake word of reproach to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cares not for me: only here today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some meddling rogue has tampered with him⁠—else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swearing men to vows impossible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make them like himself: but, friend, to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is all fault who hath no fault at all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who loves me must have a touch of earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The low sun makes the colour: I am yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Arthur’s, as ye know, save by the bond.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore hear my words: go to the jousts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When sweetest; and the vermin voices here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May buzz so loud⁠—we scorn them, but they sting.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And with what face, after my pretext made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a King who honours his own word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were his God’s?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Yea,” said the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A moral child without the craft to rule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else had he not lost me: but listen to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I must find you wit: we hear it said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men go down before your spear at a touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This conquers: hide it therefore; go unknown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Win! by this kiss you will: and our true King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all for glory; for to speak him true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye know right well, how meek soe’er he seem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No keener hunter after glory breathes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves it in his knights more than himself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They prove to him his work: win and return.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth at himself. Not willing to be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there among the solitary downs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all in loops and links among the dales</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who let him into lodging and disarmed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And issuing found the Lord of Astolat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moving to meet him in the castle court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close behind them stept the lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, his daughter: mother of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was not: some light jest among them rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter dying down as the great knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approached them: then the Lord of Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whence comes thou, my guest, and by what name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Livest thou between the lips? for by thy state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presence I might guess thee chief of those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the King, who eat in Arthur’s halls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him have I seen: the rest, his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known as they are, to me they are unknown.”</span>
			</p>

				<figcaption>Lancelot Approaching the Castle of Astolat</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Sir Lancelot, the chief of knights:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Known am I, and of Arthur’s hall, and known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I go to joust as one unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter ye shall know me⁠—and the shield⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you lend me one, if such you have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blank, or at least with some device not mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said the Lord of Astolat, “Here is Torre’s:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His ye can have.” Then added plain Sir Torre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here laughed the father saying, “Fie, Sir Churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is that answer for a noble knight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set it in this damsel’s golden hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her thrice as wilful as before.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before this noble knight,” said young Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For nothing. Surely I but played on Torre:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That someone put this diamond in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that it was too slippery to be held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The castle-well, belike; and then I said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if I went and if I fought and won it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(But all was jest and joke among ourselves)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then must she keep it safelier. All was jest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, father, give me leave, an if he will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Win shall I not, but do my best to win:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young as I am, yet would I do my best.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So will ye grace me,” answered Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiling a moment, “with your fellowship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you shall win this diamond⁠—as I hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a fair large diamond⁠—if ye may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yield it to this maiden, if ye will.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A fair large diamond,” added plain Sir Torre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Such be for queens, and not for simple maids.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If what is fair be but for what is fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only queens are to be counted so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not violating the bond of like to like.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke and ceased: the lily maid Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Won by the mellow voice before she looked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle with the love he bare his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another sinning on such heights with one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flower of all the west and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been the sleeker for it: but in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mood was often like a fiend, and rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drove him into wastes and solitudes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For agony, who was yet a living soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever among ladies ate in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However marred, of more than twice her years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved him, with that love which was her doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the great knight, the darling of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kindly man moving among his kind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom they with meats and vintage of their best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And talk and minstrel melody entertained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And much they asked of court and Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever well and readily answered he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He learnt and warned me of their fierce design</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I, my sons, and little daughter fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the great river in a boatman’s hut.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O there, great lord, doubtless,” Lavaine said, rapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward greatness in its elder, “you have fought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O tell us⁠—for we live apart⁠—you know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur’s glorious wars.” And Lancelot spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered him at full, as having been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur in the fight which all day long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the four loud battles by the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Celidon the forest; and again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had on his cuirass worn our Lady’s Head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carved of one emerald centered in a sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set every gilded parapet shuddering;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where many a heathen fell; “and on the mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Badon I myself beheld the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charge at the head of all his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his legions crying Christ and him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break them; and I saw him, after, stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red as the rising sun with heathen blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘They are broken, they are broken!’ for the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However mild he seems at home, nor cares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, his knights are better men than he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet in this heathen war the fire of God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills him: I never saw his like: there lives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No greater leader.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>While he uttered this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low to her own heart said the lily maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Save your own great self, fair lord;” and when he fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From talk of war to traits of pleasantry⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She still took note that when the living smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died from his lips, across him came a cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of melancholy severe, from which again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever in her hovering to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of manners and of nature: and she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all night long his face before her lived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when a painter, poring on a face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divinely through all hindrance finds the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind it, and so paints him that his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shape and colour of a mind and life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives for his children, ever at its best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fullest; so the face before her lived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First in fear, step after step, she stole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This shield, my friend, where is it?” and Lavaine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past inward, as she came from out the tower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearer and stood. He looked, and more amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than if seven men had set upon him, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden standing in the dewy light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For silent, though he greeted her, she stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt on his face as if it were a God’s.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he should wear her favour at the tilt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair lord, whose name I know not⁠—noble it is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe, the noblest⁠—will you wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My favour at this tourney?” “Nay,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair lady, since I never yet have worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Favour of any lady in the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, so,” she answered; “then in wearing mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That those who know should know you.” And he turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her counsel up and down within his mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found it true, and answered, “True, my child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, I will wear it: fetch it out to me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is it?” and she told him “A red sleeve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broidered with pearls,” and brought it: then he bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her token on his helmet, with a smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “I never yet have done so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any maiden living,” and the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left her all the paler, when Lavaine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brother’s; which he gave to Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In keeping till I come.” “A grace to me,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “twice today. I am your squire!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, “Lily maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear our people call you lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In earnest, let me bring your colour back;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once, twice, and thrice: now get you hence to bed:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus they moved away: she stayed a minute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her bright hair blown about the serious face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet rosy-kindled with her brother’s kiss⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, while she watched their arms far-off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the new companions past away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far o’er the long backs of the bushless downs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not far from Camelot, now for forty years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever labouring had scooped himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the white rock a chapel and a hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On massive columns, like a shorecliff cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cells and chambers: all were fair and dry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green light from the meadows underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poplars made a noise of falling showers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither wending there that night they bode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the next day broke from underground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot saying, “Hear, but hold my name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abashed young Lavaine, whose instant reverence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left him leave to stammer, “Is it indeed?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after muttering “The great Lancelot,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last he got his breath and answered, “One,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One have I seen⁠—that other, our liege lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dread Pendragon, Britain’s King of kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom the people talk mysteriously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will be there⁠—then were I stricken blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That minute, I might say that I had seen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Run through the peopled gallery which half round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robed in red samite, easily to be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the carven-work behind him crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through knots and loops and folds innumerable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The new design wherein they lost themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in the costly canopy o’er him set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Me you call great: mine is the firmer seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truer lance: but there is many a youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now crescent, who will come to all I am</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overcome it; and in me there dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No greatness, save it be some far-off touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of greatness to know well I am not great:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is the man.” And Lavaine gaped upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on a thing miraculous, and anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trumpets blew; and then did either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They that assailed, and they that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meet in the midst, and there so furiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any man that day were left afield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the stronger: little need to speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot in his glory! King, duke, earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Count, baron⁠—whom he smote, he overthrew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in the field were Lancelot’s kith and kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should do and almost overdo the deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, “Lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is he? I do not mean the force alone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grace and versatility of the man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it not Lancelot?” “When has Lancelot worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Favour of any lady in the lists?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How then? who then?” a fury seized them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fiery family passion for the name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In moving, all together down upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And him that helms it, so they overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He up the side, sweating with agony, got,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thought to do while he might yet endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being lustily holpen by the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party⁠—though it seemed half-miracle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those he fought with⁠—drave his kith and kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the Table Round that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party, cried “Advance and take thy prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The diamond;” but he answered, “Diamond me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No diamonds! for God’s love, a little air!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There from his charger down he slid, and sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gasping to Sir Lavaine, “Draw the lance-head:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot,” said Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I dread me, if I draw it, you will die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, “I die already with it: draw⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draw,”⁠—and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the hermit out and bare him in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether to live or die, for many a week</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid from the wide world’s rumour by the grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party, knights of utmost North and West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untaken, crying that his prize is death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Heaven hinder,” said the King, “that such an one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great a knight as we have seen today⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed to me another Lancelot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must not pass uncared for. Wherefore, rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge you that you get at once to horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His prowess was too wondrous. We will do him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No customary honour: since the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourselves will send it after. Rise and take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This diamond, and deliver it, and return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring us where he is, and how he fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cease not from your quest until ye find.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, from the carven flower above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which it made a restless heart, he took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave, the diamond: then from where he sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Arthur’s right, with smiling face arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mid might and flourish of his May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Modred’s brother, and the child of Lot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor often loyal to his word, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth that the King’s command to sally forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So all in wrath he got to horse and went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, thinking “Is it Lancelot who hath come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ridden away to die?” So feared the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after two days’ tarriance there, returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Love, are you yet so sick?” “Nay, lord,” she said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And where is Lancelot?” Then the Queen amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Was he not with you? won he not your prize?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, but one like him.” “Why that like was he.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the King demanded how she knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, “Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Lancelot told me of a common talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men went down before his spear at a touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all men, even the King, and to this end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made a pretext of a hindering wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might joust unknown of all, and learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If his old prowess were in aught decayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And added, ‘Our true Arthur, when he learns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will well allow me pretext, as for gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of purer glory.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then replied the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely his King and most familiar friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might well have kept his secret. True, indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit I know my knights fantastical,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fine a fear in our large Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs have moved my laughter: now remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But little cause for laughter: his own kin⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that he went sore wounded from the field:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet good news too: for goodly hopes are mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wore, against his wont, upon his helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some gentle maiden’s gift.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Yea, lord,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thy hopes are mine,” and saying that, she choked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sharply turned about to hide her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past to her chamber, and there flung herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on the great King’s couch, and writhed upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrieked out “Traitor” to the unhearing wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moved about her palace, proud and pale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gawain the while through all the region round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came at last, though late, to Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced at, and cried, “What news from Camelot, lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of the knight with the red sleeve?” “He won.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I knew it,” she said. “But parted from the jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurt in the side,” whereat she caught her breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereon she smote her hand: wellnigh she swooned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reported who he was, and on what quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The victor, but had ridden a random round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek him, and had wearied of the search.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the Lord of Astolat, “Bide with us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride no more at random, noble Prince!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This will he send or come for: furthermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must hear.” To this the courteous Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accorded with his wonted courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where could be found face daintier? then her shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From forehead down to foot, perfect⁠—again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well⁠—if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft they met among the garden yews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he set himself to play upon her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sallying wit, free flashes from a height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above her, graces of the court, and songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And amorous adulation, till the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rebelled against it, saying to him, “Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O loyal nephew of our noble King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why ask you not to see the shield he left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence you might learn his name? Why slight your King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No surer than our falcon yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the winds?” “Nay, by mine head,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But an ye will it let me see the shield.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot’s azure lions, crowned with gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And right was I,” she answered merrily, “I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And if I dreamed,” said Gawain, “that you love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak therefore: shall I waste myself in vain?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full simple was her answer, “What know I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brethren have been all my fellowship;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, when often they have talked of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not if I know what true love is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if I know, then, if I love not him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know there is none other I can love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, by God’s death,” said he, “ye love him well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But would not, knew ye what all others know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whom he loves.” “So be it,” cried Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted her fair face and moved away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he pursued her, calling, “Stay a little!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One golden minute’s grace! he wore your sleeve:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would he break faith with one I may not name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must our true man change like a leaf at last?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—like enow: why then, far be it from me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, damsel, for I deem you know full well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My quest with you; the diamond also: here!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he love, it will be sweet to have it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From your own hand; and whether he love or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A diamond is a diamond. Fare you well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand times!⁠—a thousand times farewell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May meet at court hereafter: there, I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We two shall know each other.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then he gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The diamond, and all wearied of the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence to the court he past; there told the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the King knew, “Sir Lancelot is the knight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And added, “Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But failed to find him, though I rode all round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The region: but I lighted on the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I gave the diamond: she will render it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by mine head she knows his hiding-place.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obedience is the courtesy due to kings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake and parted. Wroth, but all in awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingered that other, staring after him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the maid of Astolat, and her love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some read the King’s face, some the Queen’s, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had marvel what the maid might be, but most</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Predoomed her as unworthy. One old dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, that had heard the noise of it before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marred her friend’s aim with pale tranquillity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So ran the tale like fire about the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire in dry stubble a nine-days’ wonder flared:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lips severely placid, felt the knot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crushed the wild passion out against the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the banquet, where all the meats became</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But far away the maid in Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crept to her father, while he mused alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Father, you call me wilful, and the fault</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is yours who let me have my will, and now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” said he, “surely.” “Wherefore, let me hence,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “and find out our dear Lavaine.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bide,” answered he: “we needs must hear anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him, and of that other.” “Ay,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And of that other, for I needs must hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find that other, wheresoe’er he be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest I be found as faithless in the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden’s aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, to be sweet and serviceable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To noble knights in sickness, as ye know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When these have worn their tokens: let me hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you.” Then her father nodding said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, ay, the diamond: wit ye well, my child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being our greatest: yea, and you must give it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sure I think this fruit is hung too high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any mouth to gape for save a queen’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, I mean nothing: so then, get you gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so very wilful you must go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she made her ready for her ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her father’s latest word hummed in her ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Being so very wilful you must go,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And changed itself and echoed in her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Being so very wilful you must die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she was happy enough and shook it off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her heart she answered it and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What matter, so I help him back to life?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode o’er the long backs of the bushless downs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Camelot, and before the city-gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came on her brother with a happy face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making a roan horse caper and curvet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pleasure all about a field of flowers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom when she saw, “Lavaine,” she cried, “Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?” He amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How know ye my lord’s name is Lancelot?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the maid had told him all her tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Arthur’s wars were rendered mystically,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past up the still rich city to his kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led to the caves: there first she saw the casque</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot on the wall: her scarlet sleeve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because he had not loosed it from his helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dragging down his enemy made them move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sound not wonted in a place so still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes glistened: she fancied “Is it for me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the maid had told him all the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full lowly by the corners of his bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid the diamond in his open hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her face was near, and as we kiss the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once she slipt like water to the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas,” he said, “your ride hath wearied you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest must you have.” “No rest for me,” she said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all her heart’s sad secret blazed itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the heart’s colours on her simple face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being weak in body said no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But did not love the colour; woman’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save one, he not regarded, and so turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far up the dim rich city to her kin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There bode the night: but woke with dawn, and past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down through the dim rich city to the fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to the cave: so day by day she past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In either twilight ghost-like to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gliding, and every day she tended him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And likewise many a night: and Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would, though he called his wound a little hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncourteous, even he: but the meek maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milder than any mother to a sick child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never woman yet, since man’s first fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The simples and the science of that time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told him that her fine care had saved his life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sick man forgot her simple blush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would listen for her coming and regret</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her parting step, and held her tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved her with all love except the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of man and woman when they love their best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closest and sweetest, and had died the death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any knightly fashion for her sake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peradventure had he seen her first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have made this and that other world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another world for the sick man; but now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shackles of an old love straitened him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His honour rooted in dishonour stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These, as but born of sickness, could not live:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the blood ran lustier in him again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often the bright image of one face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or short and coldly, and she knew right well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drave her ere her time across the fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far into the rich city, where alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She murmured, “Vain, in vain: it cannot be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will not love me: how then? must I die?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then as a little helpless innocent bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That has but one plain passage of few notes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will sing the simple passage o’er and o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all an April morning, till the ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went half the night repeating, “Must I die?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now to right she turned, and now to left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found no ease in turning or in rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Him or death,” she muttered, “death or him,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again and like a burthen, “Him or death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when Sir Lancelot’s deadly hurt was whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Astolat returning rode the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I be loved, these are my festal robes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If not, the victim’s flowers before he fall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she should ask some goodly gift of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her own self or hers; “and do not shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak the wish most near to your true heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such service have ye done me, that I make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own land, and what I will I can.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a ghost without the power to speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bode among them yet a little space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found her in among the garden yews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “Delay no longer, speak your wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing I go today:” then out she brake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Going? and we shall never see you more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I must die for want of one bold word.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Speak: that I live to hear,” he said, “is yours.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have gone mad. I love you: let me die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, sister,” answered Lancelot, “what is this?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And innocently extending her white arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your love,” she said, “your love⁠—to be your wife.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot answered, “Had I chosen to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now there never will be wife of mine.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No, no,” she cried, “I care not to be wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to be with you still, to see your face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve you, and to follow you through the world.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot answered, “Nay, the world, the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blare its own interpretation⁠—nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full ill then should I quit your brother’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And your good father’s kindness.” And she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not to be with you, not to see your face⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for me then, my good days are done.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, noble maid,” he answered, “ten times nay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is not love: but love’s first flash in youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most common: yea, I know it of mine own self:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you yourself will smile at your own self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then will I, for true you are and sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More specially should your good knight be poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endow you with broad land and territory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that would make you happy: furthermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all your quarrels will I be your knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I will do, dear damsel, for your sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more than this I cannot.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>While he spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of all this will I nothing;” and so fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their talk had pierced, her father: “Ay, a flash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you, use some rough discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blunt or break her passion.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Lancelot said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That were against me: what I can I will;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there that day remained, and toward even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent for his shield: full meekly rose the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she by tact of love was well aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was the one discourtesy that he used.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in her tower alone the maiden sat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His very shield was gone; only the case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still she heard him, still his picture formed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grew between her and the pictured wall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came her father, saying in low tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have comfort,” whom she greeted quietly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came her brethren saying, “Peace to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet sister,” whom she answered with all calm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when they left her to herself again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death, like a friend’s voice from a distant field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in those days she made a little song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called her song “The Song of Love and Death,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sang it: sweetly could she make and sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fain would follow love, if that could be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needs must follow death, who calls for me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call and I follow, I follow! let me die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a fiery dawning wild with wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shuddering, “Hark the Phantom of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever shrieks before a death,” and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father, and all three in hurry and fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flared on her face, she shrilling, “Let me die!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when we dwell upon a word we know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repeating, till the word we know so well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dwelt the father on her face, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is this Elaine?” till back the maiden fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking a still good-morrow with her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last she said, “Sweet brothers, yesternight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seemed a curious little maid again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when ye used to take me with the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up the great river in the boatman’s boat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only ye would not pass beyond the cape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That has the poplar on it: there ye fixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your limit, oft returning with the tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I cried because ye would not pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond it, and far up the shining flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until we found the palace of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was all alone upon the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I said, ‘Now shall I have my will:’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there I woke, but still the wish remained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So let me hence that I may pass at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until I find the palace of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There will I enter in among them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no man there will dare to mock at me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the King will know me and my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen herself will pity me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the gentle court will welcome me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after my long voyage I shall rest!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Peace,” said her father, “O my child, ye seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light-headed, for what force is yours to go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bluster into stormy sobs and say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I never loved him: an I meet with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not howsoever great he be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I strike at him and strike him down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this discomfort he hath done the house.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the gentle sister made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot’s fault</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to love me, than it is mine to love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him of all men who seems to me the highest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Highest?” the father answered, echoing “highest?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(He meant to break the passion in her) “nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this I know, for all the people know it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she returns his love in open shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If this be high, what is it to be low?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For anger: these are slanders: never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was noble man but made ignoble talk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He makes no friend who never made a foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now it is my glory to have loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One peerless, without stain: so let me pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, howsoe’er I seem to you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all unhappy, having loved God’s best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And greatest, though my love had no return:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thanks, but you work against your own desire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if I could believe the things you say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when the ghostly man had come and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besought Lavaine to write as she devised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A letter, word for word; and when he asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I bear it gladly;” she replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I myself must bear it.” Then he wrote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The letter she devised; which being writ</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folded, “O sweet father, tender and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deny me not,” she said⁠—“ye never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Denied my fancies⁠—this, however strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My latest: lay the letter in my hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little ere I die, and close the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the heat is gone from out my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then take the little bed on which I died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot’s love, and deck it like the Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For richness, and me also like the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let there be prepared a chariot-bier</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take me to the river, and a barge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be ready on the river, clothed in black.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There surely I shall speak for mine own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none of you can speak for me so well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore let our dumb old man alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go with me, he can steer and row, and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will guide me to that palace, to the doors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ceased: her father promised; whereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her father laid the letter in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And closed the hand upon it, and she died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that day there was dole in Astolat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the next sun brake from underground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past like a shadow through the field, that shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There sat the lifelong creature of the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So those two brethren from the chariot took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the black decks laid her in her bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set in her hand a lily, o’er her hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silken case with braided blazonings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sister, farewell for ever,” and again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Farewell, sweet sister,” parted all in tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her right hand the lily, in her left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The letter⁠—all her bright hair streaming down⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the coverlid was cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All but her face, and that clear-featured face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.</span>

			<p>
				<span>That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Audience of Guinevere, to give at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The price of half a realm, his costly gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deaths of others, and almost his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nine-years-fought-for diamonds: for he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of her house, and sent him to the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such and so unmoved a majesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have seemed her statue, but that he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Queen’s shadow, vibrate on the walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All in an oriel on the summer side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vine-clad, of Arthur’s palace toward the stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, “Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take, what I had not won except for you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These jewels, and make me happy, making them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or necklace for a neck to which the swan’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is tawnier than her cygnet’s: these are words:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Words, as we grant grief tears. Such sin in words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, we both can pardon: but, my Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear of rumours flying through your court.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have in it an absoluter trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make up that defect: let rumours be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you trust me in your own nobleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I may not well believe that you believe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the place whereon she stood was green;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received at once and laid aside the gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There on a table near her, and replied:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It may be, I am quicker of belief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This good is in it, whatsoe’er of ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It can be broken easier. I for you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This many a year have done despite and wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one whom ever in my heart of hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I did acknowledge nobler. What are these?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being your gift, had you not lost your own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To loyal hearts the value of all gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must vary as the giver’s. Not for me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her! for your new fancy. Only this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me, I pray you: have your joys apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I doubt not that however changed, you keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much of what is graceful: and myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which as Arthur’s Queen I move and rule:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So cannot speak my mind. An end to this!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An armlet for an arm to which the Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O as much fairer⁠—as a faith once fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was richer than these diamonds⁠—hers not mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shall not have them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Saying which she seized,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, through the casement standing wide for heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close underneath his eyes, and right across</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon the lily maid of Astolat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All up the marble stair, tier over tier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What is it?” but that oarsman’s haggard face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As hard and still as is the face that men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shape to their fancy’s eye from broken rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He is enchanted, cannot speak⁠—and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look how she sleeps⁠—the Fairy Queen, so fair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or come to take the King to Fairyland?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that he passes into Fairyland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus they babbled of the King, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came girt with knights: then turned the tongueless man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the half-face to the full eye, and rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reverently they bore her into hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot later came and mused at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, for you left me taking no farewell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither, to take my last farewell of you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I loved you, and my love had no return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore my true love has been my death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to all other ladies, I make moan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou art a knight peerless.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Thus he read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever in the reading, lords and dames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept, looking often from his face who read</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hers which lay so silent, and at times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had devised the letter, moved again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know that for this most gentle maiden’s death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But loved me with a love beyond all love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In women, whomsoever I have known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet to be loved makes not to love again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not at my years, however it hold in youth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No cause, not willingly, for such a love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this I call my friends in testimony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her brethren, and her father, who himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break her passion, some discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against my nature: what I could, I did.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I left her and I bad her no farewell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though, had I dreamt the damsel would have died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might have put my wits to some rough use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And helped her from herself.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then said the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye might at least have done her so much grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He adding,</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Queen, she would not be content</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that I wedded her, which could not be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It could not be. I told her that her love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was but the flash of youth, would darken down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rise hereafter in a stiller flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward one more worthy of her⁠—then would I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More specially were he, she wedded, poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Estate them with large land and territory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep them in all joyance: more than this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I could not; this she would not, and she died.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He pausing, Arthur answered, “O my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will be to thy worship, as my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine, as head of all our Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see that she be buried worshipfully.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So toward that shrine which then in all the realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marshalled Order of their Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden buried, not as one unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the knights had laid her comely head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Arthur spake among them, “Let her tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be costly, and her image thereupon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be carven, and her lily in her hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the story of her dolorous voyage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In letters gold and azure!” which was wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And people, from the high door streaming, brake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew near, and sighed in passing, “Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He answered with his eyes upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That is love’s curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approached him, and with full affection said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most joy and most affiance, for I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thou hast been in battle by my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a time have watched thee at the tilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the younger and unskilled go by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To win his honour and to make his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made to be loved; but now I would to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By God for thee alone, and from her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If one may judge the living by the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delicately pure and marvellously fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born to the glory of thine name and fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Lancelot, “Fair she was, my King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To doubt her pureness were to want a heart⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could bind him, but free love will not be bound.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Free love, so bound, were freest,” said the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let love be free; free love is for the best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after heaven, on our dull side of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What should be best, if not so pure a love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She failed to bind, though being, as I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the inrunning of a little brook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat by the river in a cove, and watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw the barge that brought her moving down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in himself, “Ah simple heart and sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far tenderer than my Queen’s. Pray for thy soul?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, that will I. Farewell too⁠—now at last⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell, fair lily. ‘Jealousy in love?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rather dead love’s harsh heir, jealous pride?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not your crescent fear for name and fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why did the King dwell on my name to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught from his mother’s arms⁠—the wondrous one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who passes through the vision of the night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She kissed me saying, ‘Thou art fair, my child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a king’s son,’ and often in her arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would she had drowned me in it, where’er it be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what am I? what profits me my name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of greatest knight? I fought for it, and have it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now grown a part of me: but what use in it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make men worse by making my sin known?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for Arthur’s greatest knight, a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not after Arthur’s heart! I needs must break</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These bonds that so defame me: not without</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wills it: would I, if she willed it? nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray him, send a sudden Angel down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seize me by the hair and bear me far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the tumbled fragments of the hills.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not knowing he should die a holy man.</span>
