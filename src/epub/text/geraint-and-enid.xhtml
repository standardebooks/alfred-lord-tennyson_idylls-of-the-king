			<h2 epub:type="title">Geraint and Enid</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O purblind race of miserable men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How many among us at this very hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By taking true for false, or false for true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, through the feeble twilight of this world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groping, how many, until we pass and reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That other, where we see as we are seen!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That morning, when they both had got to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps because he loved her passionately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not at my side. I charge thee ride before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever a good way on before; and this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever happens, not to speak to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, not a word!” and Enid was aghast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When crying out, “Effeminate as I am,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not fight my way with gilded arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All shall be iron;” he loosed a mighty purse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the last sight that Enid had of home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chafing his shoulder: then he cried again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To the wilds!” and Enid leading down the tracks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through which he bad her lead him on, they past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stranger meeting them had surely thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he was ever saying to himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O I that wasted time to tend upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To compass her with sweet observances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dress her beautifully and keep her true”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he broke the sentence in his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May break it, when his passion masters him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she was ever praying the sweet heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save her dear lord whole from any wound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever in her mind she cast about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that unnoticed failing in herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the great plover’s human whistle amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In ever wavering brake an ambuscade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thought again, “If there be such in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he would only speak and tell me of it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the fourth part of the day was gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Enid was aware of three tall knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard one crying to his fellow, “Look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, we will slay him and will have his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will go back a little to my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, be he wroth even to slaying me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she went back some paces of return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they would slay you, and possess your horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He made a wrathful answer: “Did I wish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your warning or your silence? one command</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I laid upon you, not to speak to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus ye keep it! Well then, look⁠—for now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long for my life, or hunger for my death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down upon him bare the bandit three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out beyond; and then against his brace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lance that splintered like an icicle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung from his brand a windy buffet out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or slew them, and dismounting like a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That skins the wild beast after slaying him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The three gay suits of armour which they wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of armour on their horses, each on each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, and said to her, “Drive them on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before you;” and she drove them through the waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He followed nearer; ruth began to work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against his anger in him, while he watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The being he loved best in all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With difficulty in mild obedience</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driving them on: he fain had spoken to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But evermore it seemed an easier thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once without remorse to strike her dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to cry “Halt,” and to her own bright face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accuse her of the least immodesty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she could speak whom his own ear had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call herself false: and suffering thus he made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Minutes an age: but in scarce longer time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before he turn to fall seaward again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook her pulses, crying, “Look, a prize!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all in charge of whom? a girl: set on.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” said the second, “yonder comes a knight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third, “A craven; how he hangs his head.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giant answered merrily, “Yea, but one?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid pondered in her heart and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will abide the coming of my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will tell him all their villainy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lord is weary with the fight before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they will fall upon him unawares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needs must disobey him for his good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How should I dare obey him to his harm?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I save a life dearer to me than mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she abode his coming, and said to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With timid firmness, “Have I leave to speak?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, “Ye take it, speaking,” and she spoke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each of them is wholly armed, and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they will fall upon you while ye pass.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To which he flung a wrathful answer back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And if there were an hundred in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every man were larger-limbed than I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all at once should sally out upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear it would not ruffle me so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As you that not obey me. Stand aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I fall, cleave to the better man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid stood aside to wait the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little in the late encounter strained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck through the bulky bandit’s corselet home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there lay still; as he that tells the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw once a great piece of a promontory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That had a sapling growing on it, slide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the long shore-cliff’s windy walls to the beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So lay the man transfixt. His craven pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On whom the victor, to confound them more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All through the crash of the near cataract hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drumming thunder of the huger fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, but, overtaken, died the death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.</span>

				<figcaption>Geraint Charges the Bandits</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound them on their horses, each on each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, and said to her, “Drive them on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before you,” and she drove them through the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He followed nearer still: the pain she had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, served a little to disedge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sharpness of that pain about her heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they themselves, like creatures gently born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But into bad hands fallen, and now so long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her low firm voice and tender government.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So through the green gloom of the wood they past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And issuing under open heavens beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little town with towers, upon a rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down a rocky pathway from the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare victual for the mowers: and Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, willingly,” replied the youth; “and thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only meet for mowers;” then set down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His basket, and dismounting on the sward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid took a little delicately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less having stomach for it than desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To close with her lord’s pleasure; but Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate all the mowers’ victual unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he found all empty, was amazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Boy,” said he, “I have eaten all, but take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, reddening in extremity of delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will be all the wealthier,” cried the Prince.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I take it as free gift, then,” said the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not guerdon; for myself can easily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these are his, and all the field is his,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself am his; and I will tell him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How great a man thou art: he loves to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When men of mark are in his territory:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he will have thee to his palace here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And serve thee costlier than with mowers’ fare.”</span>

				<figcaption>Geraint and Enid in the Meadow</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>Then said Geraint, “I wish no better fare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never ate with angrier appetite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into no Earl’s palace will I go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know, God knows, too much of palaces!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he want me, let him come to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hire us some fair chamber for the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stalling for the horses, and return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With victual for these men, and let us know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea, my kind lord,” said the glad youth, and went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up the rocky pathway disappeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leading the horse, and they were left alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Enid, where she droopt: his own false doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shadow of mistrust should never cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with another humorous ruth remarked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after nodded sleepily in the heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, remembering her old ruined hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the windy clamour of the daws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About her hollow turret, plucked the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There growing longest by the meadow’s edge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into many a listless annulet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told them of a chamber, and they went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, after saying to her, “If ye will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call for the woman of the house,” to which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “Thanks, my lord;” the two remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart by all the chamber’s width, and mute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or two wild men supporters of a shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one at other, parted by the shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On a sudden, many a voice along the street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heel against the pavement echoing, burst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their drowse; and either started while the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And midmost of a rout of roisterers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her suitor in old years before Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He moving up with pliant courtliness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found Enid with the corner of his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew her sitting sad and solitary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to his fashion, bad the host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call in what men soever were his friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feast with these in honour of their Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drank till he jested with all ease, and told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made it of two colours; for his talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wine and free companions kindled him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To laughter and his comrades to applause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To your good damsel there who sits apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seems so lonely?” “My free leave,” he said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get her to speak: she doth not speak to me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:</span>

				<span>“Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid, my early and my only love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What chance is this? how is it I see you here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet fear me not: I call mine own self wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But keep a touch of sweet civility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought, but that your father came between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In former days you saw me favourably.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if it were so do not keep it back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make me a little happier: let me know it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You come with no attendance, page or maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve you⁠—doth he love you as of old?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, call it lovers’ quarrels, yet I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though men may bicker with the things they love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would not make them laughable in all eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your story, that this man loves you no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your beauty is no beauty to him now:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A common chance⁠—right well I know it⁠—palled⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I know men: nor will ye win him back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the man’s love once gone never returns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here is one who loves you as of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With more exceeding passion than of old:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good, speak the word: my followers ring him round:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They understand: nay; I do not mean blood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My malice is no deeper than a moat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No stronger than a wall: there is the keep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one true lover whom you ever owned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will make use of all the power I have.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O pardon me! the madness of that hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this the tender sound of his own voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered with such craft as women use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That breaks upon them perilously, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Earl, if you love me as in former years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And do not practise on me, come with morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snatch me from him as by violence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave me tonight: I am weary to the death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He moving homeward babbled to his men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How Enid never loved a man but him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Debating his command of silence given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that she now perforce must violate it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held commune with herself, and while she held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wake him, but hung o’er him, wholly pleased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find him yet unwounded after fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear him breathing low and equally.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pieces of his armour in one place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All to be there against a sudden need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that day’s grief and travel, evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went slipping down horrible precipices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his rout of random followers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was the red cock shouting to the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the gray dawn stole o’er the dewy world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glimmered on his armour in the room.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once again she rose to look at it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But touched it unawares: jangling, the casque</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell, and he started up and stared at her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then breaking his command of silence given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She told him all that Earl Limours had said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the passage that he loved her not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor left untold the craft herself had used;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ended with apology so sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So justified by that necessity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That though he thought “was it for him she wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Devon?” he but gave a wrathful groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “Your sweet faces make good fellows fools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And traitors. Call the host and bid him bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charger and palfrey.” So she glided out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the heavy breathings of the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a household Spirit at the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, did him service as a squire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thy reckoning, friend?” and ere he learnt it, “Take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five horses and their armours;” and the host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will be all the wealthier,” said the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then to Enid, “Forward! and today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge you, Enid, more especially,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thing soever ye may hear, or see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fancy (though I count it of small use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid answered, “Yea, my lord, I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the violent threats you do not hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see the danger which you cannot see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost beyond me: yet I would obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea so,” said he, “do it: be not too wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all mismated with a yawning clown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one with arms to guard his head and yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With eyes to find you out however far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ears to hear you even in his dreams.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that he turned and looked as keenly at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As careful robins eye the delver’s toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that within her, which a wanton fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led from the territory of false Limours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the waste earldom of another earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went Enid with her sullen follower on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More near by many a rood than yestermorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waving an angry hand as who should say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye watch me,” saddened all her heart again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then not to disobey her lord’s behest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet to give him warning, for he rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if he heard not, moving back she held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At which the warrior in his obstinacy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because she kept the letter of his word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the moment after, wild Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down by the length of lance and arm beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overthrew the next that followed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the flash and motion of the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of darting fish, that on a summer morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come slipping o’er their shadows on the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if a man who stands upon the brink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lift a shining hand against the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is not left the twinkle of a fin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, scared but at the motion of the man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left him lying in the public way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So vanish friendships only made in wine.</span>

				<figcaption>The Flight of the Boon Companions of Earl Limours</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who saw the chargers of the two that fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixt with the flyers. “Horse and man,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All of one mind and all right-honest friends!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a hoof left: and I methinks till now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was honest⁠—paid with horses and with arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so what say ye, shall we strip him there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No?⁠—then do thou, being right honest, pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I too would still be honest.” Thus he said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answering not one word, she led the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as a man to whom a dreadful loss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls in a far land and he knows it not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But coming back he learns it, and the loss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In combat with the follower of Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bled underneath his armour secretly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at a sudden swerving of the road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though happily down on a bank of grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly came, and at his side all pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tearing off her veil of faded silk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord’s life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then after all was done that hand could do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She rested, and her desolation came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her, and she wept beside the way.</span>

				<figcaption>Enid Tends Geraint</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>And many past, but none regarded her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in that realm of lawless turbulence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman weeping for her murdered mate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was cared as much for as a summer shower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before an ever-fancied arrow, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scoured into the coppices and was lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came riding with a hundred lances up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried out with a big voice, “What, is he dead?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No, no, not dead!” she answered in all haste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would some of your people take him up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said Earl Doorm: “Well, if he be not dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be he dead, I count you for a fool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your wailing will not quicken him: dead or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, since the face is comely⁠—some of you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An if he live, we will have him of our band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he die, why earth has earth enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hide him. See ye take the charger too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A noble one.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He spake, and past away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each growling like a dog, when his good bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seems to be plucked at by the village boys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love to vex him eating, and he fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gnawing and growling: so the ruffians growled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their chance of booty from the morning’s raid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as they brought upon their forays out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those that might be wounded; laid him on it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in the hollow of his shield, and took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(His gentle charger following him unled)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast him and the bier in which he lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on an oaken settle in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then departed, hot in haste to join</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their luckier mates, but growling as before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might as well have blest her: she was deaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blessing or to cursing save from one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the naked hall, propping his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found his own dear bride propping his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt the warm tears falling on his face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said to his own heart, “She weeps for me:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might prove her to the uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say to his own heart, “She weeps for me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in the falling afternoon returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each hurling down a heap of things that rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doffed his helm: and then there fluttered in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mingled with the spearmen: and Earl Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck with a knife’s haft hard against the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none spake word, but all sat down at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ate with tumult in the naked hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Enid shrank far back into herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A damsel drooping in a corner of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he remembered her, and how she wept;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of her there came a power upon him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising on the sudden he said, “Eat!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never yet beheld a thing so pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God’s curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat! Look yourself. Good luck had your good man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For were I dead who is it would weep for me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I beheld a lily like yourself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so there lived some colour in your cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is not one among my gentlewomen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But listen to me, and by me be ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will do the thing I have not done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will live like two birds in one nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will fetch you forage from all fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I compel all creatures to my will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke: the brawny spearman let his cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes it earth, hissed each at other’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What shall not be recorded⁠—women they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Women, or what had been those gracious things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now desired the humbling of their best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, would have helped him to it: and all at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hated her, who took no thought of them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But answered in low voice, her meek head yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drooping, “I pray you of your courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He being as he is, to let me be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a mighty patron, satisfied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what himself had done so graciously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, “Yea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She answered meekly, “How should I be glad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth in all the world at anything,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until my lord arise and look upon me?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all but empty heart and weariness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bare her by main violence to the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrust the dish before her, crying, “Eat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No, no,” said Enid, vext, “I will not eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till yonder man upon the bier arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eat with me.” “Drink, then,” he answered. “Here!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God’s curse, with anger⁠—often I myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not so,” she cried, “by Heaven, I will not drink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drink with me; and if he rise no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not look at wine until I die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this he turned all red and paced his hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And coming up close to her, said at last:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take warning: yonder man is surely dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I compel all creatures to my will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not eat nor drink? And wherefore wail for one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By dressing it in rags? Amazed am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding how ye butt against my wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I forbear you thus: cross me no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At least put off to please me this poor gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This silken rag, this beggar-woman’s weed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love that beauty should go beautifully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see ye not my gentlewomen here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How gay, how suited to the house of one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise therefore; robe yourself in this: obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Played into green, and thicker down the front</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with the dawn ascending lets the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike where it clung: so thickly shone the gems.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Enid answered, harder to be moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With life-long injuries burning unavenged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now their hour has come; and Enid said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved me serving in my father’s hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this poor gown I rode with him to court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When now we rode upon this fatal quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of honour, where no honour can be gained:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this poor gown I will not cast aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until himself arise a living man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid me cast it. I have griefs enough:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never loved, can never love but him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He being as he is, to let me be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took his russet beard between his teeth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying, “I count it of no more avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take my salute,” unknightly with flat hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However lightly, smote her on the cheek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since she thought, “He had not dared to do it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except he surely knew my lord was dead,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a wild thing taken in the trap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(It lay beside him in the hollow shield),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the men and women in the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yelling as from a spectre, and the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were left alone together, and he said:</span>
			</p>

				<figcaption>Geraint Slays Earl Doorm</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				<span>“Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done you more wrong: we both have undergone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That trouble which has left me thrice your own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here I lay this penance on myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard you say, that you were no true wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do believe yourself against yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will henceforward rather die than doubt.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid could not say one tender word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She only prayed him, “Fly, they will return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay you; fly, your charger is without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My palfrey lost.” “Then, Enid, shall you ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind me.” “Yea,” said Enid, “let us go.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moving out they found the stately horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now no more a vassal to the thief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a low whinny toward the pair: and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kissed the white star upon his noble front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She set her own and climbed; he turned his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About him, and at once they rode away.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And never yet, since high in Paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the four rivers the first roses blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put hand to hand beneath her husband’s heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt him hers again: she did not weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But o’er her meek eyes came a happy mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like that which kept the heart of Eden green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the useful trouble of the rain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As not to see before them on the path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knight of Arthur’s court, who laid his lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrieked to the stranger “Slay not a dead man!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The voice of Enid,” said the knight; but she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love you, Prince, with something of the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once, when I was up so high in pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By overthrowing me you threw me higher.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, made a knight of Arthur’s Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since I knew this Earl, when I myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The King is close behind me) bidding him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He hears the judgment of the King of kings,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried the wan Prince; “and lo, the powers of Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are scattered,” and he pointed to the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were men and women staring and aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the knight besought him, “Follow me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prince, to the camp, and in the King’s own ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange chances here alone;” that other flushed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hung his head, and halted in reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after madness acted question asked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Edyrn crying, “If ye will not go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Enough,” he said, “I follow,” and they went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid in their going had two fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One from the bandit scattered in the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one from Edyrn. Every now and then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shrank a little. In a hollow land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which old fires have broken, men may fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh fire and ruin. He, perceiving, said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yourself were first the blameless cause to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My nature’s prideful sparkle in the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break into furious flame; being repulsed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until I overturned him; then set up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(With one main purpose ever at my heart)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, toppling over all antagonism,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So waxed in pride, that I believed myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should have slain your father, seized yourself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lived in hope that sometime you would come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these my lists with him whom best you loved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold me overturn and trample on him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should not less have killed him. And so you came⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once you came⁠—and with your own true eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks of a service done him) overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My proud self, and my purpose three years old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set his foot upon me, and give me life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was I broken down; there was I saved:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the penance the Queen laid upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was but to rest awhile within her court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waiting to be treated like a wolf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such fine reserve and noble reticence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of tenderest courtesy, that I began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glance behind me at my former life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find that it had been the wolf’s indeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you were often there about the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept myself aloof till I was changed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and Enid easily believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like simple noble natures, credulous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There most in those who most have done them ill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they reached the camp the King himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Advanced to greet them, and beholding her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In converse for a little, and returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed an empty tent allotted her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing for a minute, till he saw her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To move to your own land, and there defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By having looked too much through alien eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrought too long with delegated hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not used mine own: but now behold me come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Edyrn and with others: have ye looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This work of his is great and wonderful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His very face with change of heart is changed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world will not believe a man repents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this wise world of ours is mainly right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full seldom doth a man repent, or use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of blood and custom wholly out of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I will weed this land before I go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rashly, but have proved him everyway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of our noblest, our most valorous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sanest and most obedient: and indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After a life of violence, seems to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand-fold more great and wonderful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My subject with my subjects under him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should make an onslaught single on a realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were himself nigh wounded to the death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His work was neither great nor wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past to Enid’s tent; and thither came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King’s own leech to look into his hurt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid tended on him there; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her constant motion round him, and the breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled all the genial courses of his blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deeper and with ever deeper love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the south-west that blowing Bala lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills all the sacred Dee. So past the days.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each of all whom Uther left in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long since, to guard the justice of the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked and found them wanting; and as now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rooted out the slothful officer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in their chairs set up a stronger race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To till the wastes, and moving everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cleared the dark places and let in the law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clothed her in apparel like the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though Geraint could never take again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That comfort from their converse which he took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the Queen’s fair name was breathed upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rested well content that all was well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fifty knights rode with them to the shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Severn, and they past to their own land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he kept the justice of the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being ever foremost in the chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And victor at the tilt and tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They called him the great Prince and man of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid the Fair, a grateful people named</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid the Good; and in their halls arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cry of children, Enids and Geraints</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rested in her fealty, till he crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A happy life with a fair death, and fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the heathen of the Northern Sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle, fighting for the blameless King.</span>
